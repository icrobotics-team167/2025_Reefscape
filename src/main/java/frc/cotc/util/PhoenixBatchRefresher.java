/**
 * Calling {@link BaseStatusSignal#refreshAll(BaseStatusSignal...)} has a measurable increase in
 * performance due to reduced JNI and data read/write overhead compared to calling {@link
 * StatusSignal#refresh()} on individual signals.
 *
 * <p>To maximize performance, all {@link BaseStatusSignal}s that aren't on separate threads are
 * batched together into one call via a global state in this class.
 *
 * <p>Kinda ugly since it becomes way less clear when data is being updated and global state stuff
 * is hard to debug but sometimes you gotta prioritize the RoboRIO's happiness over your own.
